# Python_InteractWithSlack

Using slack API to post tensorflow results to Slack channel

Step 1. You will need to create a Slack API token and paste it into an empty "slack_api_python.txt" inside the current folder

Step 2. Have "..\tensorflow-r1.10\tensorflow\python" as one of your system path and python path entries in the system var

Step 3. Run Slacker_Interact.py to get connected to Slack and create correct channel; Slacker_Interact2.py to build the model using tensorflow; Slacker_Interact3.py to do predictions with keras.

Step 4. All progresses are updated to slack channel in real time.
